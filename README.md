# express-blog
A blog made with Express to improve my DB and backend skills.

## Requirements
- Node.js, npm, MongoDB

## How to get started
1. Clone the repo.
2. `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. Make sure MongoDB is running locally if you're using a local DB.
4. - `npm run start` to run the application at http://localhost:6969/
   - `npm run dev` to run the application in development mode.

## Technology Stack:
- HTML, CSS, SemanticUI
- Node.js, Express
- MongoDB

## Outcome of this mini-project
- I feel much more comfortable with MongoDB and REST after building this. I think i can manage CRUD operations quite easily now. I also tried SemanticUI for the first time, but i think i'll stick with Bootstrap. I feel that i can do a lot more with what i have gained building this.
